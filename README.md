Our own LyrarmaIDE. Better than default python's IDE.


Our IDE was developed by LimneticGG in order to create a user-friendly version of IDLE without garbage and with all the necessary functions.

- Only python-3 code
- Full LIDE configuration in settings.json, starting from the size of the tabs in the spaces, the colors of each (or almost) element, ending with the functions and keywords that will be highlighted
- Multiple complete translations (comming soon)
- You can write any program on LIDE, the developers allow the use of their program for programming any (including commercial) projects.
